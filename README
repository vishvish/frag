## a FreeAgent CLI utility

I am bored of faffing around with the FreeAgent GUI, it's slow and repetitive.

So I'm making this CLI tool to help me deal with some of these repetitive tasks, like expenses and transaction categorization.

I'm only writing it for Mac, but it'll probably work on other platforms.
