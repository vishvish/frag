# FRAG

## a FreeAgent CLI utility

I am bored of faffing around with the FreeAgent GUI, it's slow and repetitive.

So I'm making this CLI tool to help me deal with some of these repetitive tasks, like expenses and transaction categorization.

I'm only writing it for Mac, but it'll probably work on other platforms.


## Usage

    frag login      # fires up browser to authorize app and obtain token
    frag get        # sample command to fetch project list


Tokens are stored in the Mac OS Keychain. If a token is not found, frag exits and asks you to login instead.
